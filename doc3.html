a “growth above all else” mindset fueled an impression that nothing could throttle the fintech sector. In 2022, the rose-tinted glasses began to come off. From rising interest rates and inflation to more tepid investor sentiments and widespread layoffs, a significant — and, dare we say, overdue — reality check has begun to set in for fintech providers large and small.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A turbulent macroeconomic environment has arrived against the backdrop of a change in the fintech distribution model. Fintech is increasingly becoming</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“embedded” by companies across industries. Paired with the current economic climate, the move toward embedded finance has attractively positioned infrastructure-oriented fintech providers, which are often characterized by <span style=" color: #231F20;">slower cash burn rates and stickier institutional relationships. Behind the scenes, this trend is helping to foster a deeper sense of “better together” between fintechs and</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">incumbent financial institutions. Partnerships between the old and new guards of the financial services sector are becoming more commonplace as both parties look to address customers’ growing requirement for finance at the moment of need.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">About this report</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reports such as this showcase insights derived from a variety of market-level research inputs, including financial data, M&amp;A information and other market data sources both proprietary to S&amp;P Global and publicly available.

Embedded finance and banking as a service are accelerating, partnerships between banks and fintechs are deepening, and fintech adoption rates among consumers and enterprises are increasing. While business-to-business and business-to-consumer fintech models remain prominent, the</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">emphasis on B2B2B and B2B2C distribution has increased throughout 2022. F<span style=" color: #333;">intech has evolved into something of an infrastructure layer that existing B2B and B2C organizations can build on to create new products and value propositions for their own customers. The direction of travel for the industry is now embedding and delivering financial products at the moment of need, which has attractively positioned fintech infrastructure providers with</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">as-a-service models. We expect this trend to both broaden and deepen moving into 2023, ultimately expanding the overall size of the fintech market opportunity.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2023 is likely to be a defining year for many fintechs as they navigate heightened market uncertainty and turbulence. The reality of needing to do more with less will settle in much of the market, and establishing staying power will demand recommitment to business fundamentals. Focusing on sustainable growth, taking measured risks and operating with greater pragmatism will be imperative. Further market consolidation seems inevitable, but so is further innovation. After all, it bears remembering that the modern fintech ecosystem was largely born out of the Great Recession.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trends we anticipate for 2023</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 20pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trend #1: Payment processors will double down on their payments-as-a-service strategies</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/200247/Toc" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;" target="_blank">As more SMBs turn to software to run their businesses, SMB software providers are increasingly looking to offer payment processing services to enhance their customers’ user experience while increasing product stickiness and, of course, revenue. The upshot for the payments industry? Software is replacing bank branches and feet-on-the-street sales forces as the SMB payment processing distribution model. To adapt, payment service providers (PSPs) must pivot to a one-to-many approach to SMB customer acquisition by </a><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/200247/Toc" class="s13" target="_blank">pursuing partnerships with software </a>platforms<span class="s9">.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stripe Inc., through its Connect offering, was among the earliest to recognize this trend, helping it gain a meaningful head start in securing relationships with some of the largest software platforms such as Shopify Inc. and Xero Ltd. Many others, including Adyen NV, BlueSnap Inc. and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) Inc. via its recent acquisition of Payrix Solution LLC, have worked throughout 2022 to position themselves as more attractive partners for software platforms that want to embed payment processing in their offerings. Looking ahead, most PSPs will need a payments- as-a-service strategy to remain competitive. Given the acceleration of the market and the sheer number of vertical SaaS platforms now looking to get into payments, we anticipate M&amp;A could likely serve as an entry point for PSPs that are late movers, with targets such as Finix Payments Inc. and Tilled Inc. remaining. We also expect more PSPs to offer adjacent financial capabilities on an as-a-service basis, including working capital and card issuance, as Stripe and Adyen do today.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">Trend #2: U.S. banking regulators and agencies will ramp up their fintech focus</a></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fintech industry has generally avoided intense scrutiny from U.S. banking regulators and government agencies, but this has begun to change in 2022. In</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">late Q3, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its report on buy now, pay later (BNPL) following an inquiry launched in January 2021. The CFPB report called out several concerns pertaining to BNPL, including data harvesting and</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit overextension. It also indicated that the agency would begin developing guidance for BNPL providers and subjecting them to supervisory examinations akin to those required of credit card issuers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has also begun to take a more active stance, particularly toward banking as a service (BaaS). In August, the OCC cracked down on the BaaS compliance practices of Blue Ridge Bank NA, requiring the bank to, among other things, secure OCC approval prior to onboarding new fintech partners or launching new products and services with existing fintech partners. Tellingly, the OCC announced in November that it would establish an Office of Financial Technology in early 2023 to “provide strategic leadership, vision and perspective for the OCC’s financial technology activities and related supervision.”</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While more government oversight of fintech should be expected, it’s not necessarily bad news. More</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">clarity from regulators gives fintech providers a better sense of the boundaries they can innovate within and removes ambiguity about the rules of engagement. If effectively implemented, clearer regulatory guidelines could drive further fintech innovation.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trend #3: Faster payments will find more takers, newer use cases</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rise of real-time payments (RTP) in India, Brazil and Southeast Asia has spurred other countries to embrace open banking protocols and modernize their payment infrastructures. We believe universal bank</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">participation, allowing fintechs to gain direct or indirect (via sponsor banks) access to the core infrastructure, and building digital layer capabilities to support various payment use cases in both online and offline scenarios are critical to the success of RTP markets.

As the digital economy accelerates, businesses of all varieties — fintechs, merchants and banks — cannot afford to allow fraud prevention to jeopardize their ability to attract, win and retain customers. The stakes are high. According to</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/201166/Toc" style=" color: #231F20; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;" target="_blank">our </a><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/201166/Toc" class="s13" target="_blank">VoCUL: Connected Customer, Quantifying the Customer Experience 2022 </a>survey<span class="p">, 29% of consumers have abandoned a transaction due to a false decline in the last six months. While reducing payment friction is an imperative, lowering the bar too much can be equally detrimental, considering 47% of consumers indicate that experiencing fraud would make them significantly less likely to interact with a preferred brand or retailer in the future.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With both relationships and revenue in jeopardy, businesses must take near-term steps to align their fraud prevention and customer experience priorities. Harnessing digital identity networks and leveraging dynamic/risk-based approaches to authentication</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are part of the equation, but it’s important to recognize that fighting fraud is a bigger task than can be handled effectively by the fraud and risk management team alone. This team should collaborate with the customer experience group to ensure there is a unified understanding of the impact of fraud (and preventative efforts) on the end-to- end customer journey. Given the growing intersection of these areas, we expect that more CX professionals will have a seat at the table for fraud-prevention discussions in 2023. Fraud-prevention vendors should tailor their value propositions accordingly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trend #5: Venture capitalists will gravitate toward fintech infrastructure providers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Venture capital may remain restrained in 2023, but we anticipate the investment case for technology-driven business models in financial services will gain strength. Amid rising capital costs, venture capitalists will focus on runways and profitability and are likely to steer clear of capital-intensive businesses. Fintechs with infrastructure models will, however, enjoy a more positive outlook due to their slower cash burn rates and stickier institutional relationships with banks and enterprises. Consider that fintech providers delivering their products on an as-a-service basis raised more than $2 billion in 2022 (through October), according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/200561/Toc" class="s13" target="_blank">Infrastructure providers of various kinds have a role to </a>play<span class="s14"> </span><span class="p">in enabling the three major digital transformations currently underway: fintechs managing customer relationships as challenger or neo-banks; nonbanks embedding finance into day-to-day software; and traditional financial institutions and enterprises undertaking modernization.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As fintech infrastructure companies gain scale, banks and technology companies will see significant cost benefits in outsourcing more components of their stack.

To win the trust of investors, startups must evolve from enabling narrowly defined use cases to developing capabilities across the life cycle — from customer onboarding to retrieving data to payments acceptance to value-added services such as card issuance and loan origination. Under pressure to reduce cash burn, we expect some fintechs with B2B or B2C models to pivot toward B2B2B and B2B2C infrastructure provider models.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">Trend #6: Brands will move deeper into embedded finance</a></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://clients.451research.com/reportaction/101322/Toc" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;" target="_blank">Non-financial brands as diverse as Walgreen Co., T-Mobile US Inc., Apple Inc., Walmart Inc. and McLaren Racing Ltd. have made deeper moves into embedded finance over the past 18 months.

The trend is unfolding across  a range of verticals, including e-commerce, mobility, travel and delivery platforms. This is transforming the common conception of financial services as stand-alone products to one of embeddable offerings that integrate into the user interface of other digital products. Banks have a role to play here, and those that do often see greater growth  by serving consumers and businesses tethered to digital platforms than through their proprietary distribution channels.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“White-label” banking offerings will bring banks to a much larger playing field compared to current co-branded arrangements. Further, banking-as-a-service relationships</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">can allow financial institutions to reclaim some of the market share conceded to fintechs. With white-label offerings, banks can bring to bear their account opening and management and compliance and regulatory capabilities. We expect white-label integrations to accelerate across categories such as savings and current accounts, closed-loop wallets, cards, BNPL, insurance, and personal and mortgage loans.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While some banks have been wary of conceding control over consumer relationships, we expect to see more of them externalizing their products and services to their nonbanking partners (see Figure 2).

Today, they are partnering to bring digital banking products and other types of financial services to market. Effective collaboration between banks and fintechs requires finding the right partners for business needs, integrating systems and managing ongoing operational processes and compliance. This has given rise to a new wave of fintechs, such as </a>Synctera <span class="s14"> </span>Inc.<span class="s14"> </span><span class="p">and Apiture Inc., that serve as intermediaries</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to orchestrate integrations between banks’ legacy technology stacks and their more modern fintech partners.

We see a growing opportunity for more types of such orchestrators, with the aim of accelerating time to market and providing simplified access to a wide range of financial products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trend #9: The fintech ecosystem will zero in on financial inclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fintechs and financial institutions are recognizing an opportunity to expand the financial services market opportunity by better serving unbanked and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">underbanked consumers. Financial inclusion initiatives and use cases are becoming increasingly abundant across the fintech ecosystem. For example, Nova  Credit Inc.’s Credit Passport platform helps standardize international credit data for U.S. underwriters so that immigrants can have easier access to credit. SolasAI and Zest AI Inc. are using AI/ML to connect to more data points to make lending more equitable. Various financial institutions are removing or capping overdraft fees in response to pressure from fintechs, including some of the largest banks that have long profited from these types of fees. Outside of the U.S., Latin America has emerged as a hotbed for financial inclusion fintech activity, especially in markets such as Brazil.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ultimately, the movement toward more accessible and affordable financial services is pushing financial institutions and fintechs alike to reevaluate their customer acquisition strategies and revenue models.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We expect a greater emphasis on equitable approaches to financial services in the years ahead, especially against the backdrop of an enhanced industry-wide focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

With embedded lending, fintechs and their bank partners extend their infrastructure so non-financial companies can offer lending services under their own brand, such as by offering working capital, credit cards and point-of- sale financing.
